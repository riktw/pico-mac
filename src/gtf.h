 * The GTF EXCEL(TM) SPREADSHEET, a sample (and the definitive)
 * implementation of the GTF Timing Standard, is available at:

 * ftp://ftp.vesa.org/pub/GTF/GTF_V1R1.xls
 *
 *
 *
 * This program takes a desired resolution and vertical refresh rate,
 * and computes mode timings according to the GTF Timing Standard.
 * These mode timings can then be formatted as an XServer modeline
 * or a mode description for use by fbset(8).
 *
 *
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The GTF allows for computation of "margins" (the visible border
 * surrounding the addressable video); on most non-overscan type
 * systems, the margin period is zero.  I've implemented the margin
 * computations but not enabled it because 1) I don't really have
 * any experience with this, and 2) neither XServer modelines nor
 * fbset fb.modes provide an obvious way for margin timings to be
 * included in their mode descriptions (needs more investigation).
 *
 * The GTF provides for computation of interlaced mode timings;
 * I've implemented the computations but not enabled them, yet.
 * I should probably enable and test this at some point.
 *
 *
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 * o Add support for interlaced modes.
 *
 * o Implement the other portions of the GTF: compute mode timings
 *   given either the desired pixel clock or the desired horizontal
 *   frequency.
 *
 * o It would be nice if this were more general purpose to do things
 *   outside the scope of the GTF: like generate double scan mode
 *   timings, for example.
 *
 * o Printing digits to the right of the decimal point when the
 *   digits are 0 annoys me.
 *
 * o Error checking.
